# Purpose
The main purpose of this document is to introduce the basic usage of OpenRPDK flow for those users who are new to OpenRPDK.
A simple design flow is used as an example to show the whole design philosophy starting, which goes from the schematic capture and ending at post-layout simulatiom and DFM verification. 

# Design Phases
The whole flow is divided into several phases to match general logic or mix-signal design flows. Which are Schematic capture, Pre-layout simulation, Layout creation, Physical verification ,  Post-layoutsimulation and DFM verification.
