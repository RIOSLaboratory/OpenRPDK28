# Purpose
The main purpose of this document is to introduce the basic usage of OpenRPDK flow for those users who are new to OpenRPDK.
A simple design flow is used as an example to show the whole design philosophy starting, which goes from the schematic capture and ending at post-layout simulatiom and DFM verification. 

# Design Phases
The whole flow is divided into several phases to match general logic or mix-signal design flows. Which are：

1）Schematic capture

2）Pre-layout simulation

3）Layout creation 

4）Physical verification

5）Post-layoutsimulation

6）DFM verification
