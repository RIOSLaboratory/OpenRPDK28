# Design Technology Co-Optimization

Design Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) analysis was pursued for library cell or chip PPA estimates for devices and new metallurgy options.  The cell design and process recommendations are a bit surprising.

Physical and electrical models for scaled devices and interconnects were derived and IP design progressed while the process was being qualified.  Several factors led to the need for a much closer collaboration between process technology and std cell library development, a partnership which has been described as Design Technology Co-Optimization” (DTCO),
